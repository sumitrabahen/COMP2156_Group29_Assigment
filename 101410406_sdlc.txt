DevOps prioritizes collaboration and communication across development, operations, 
and other stakeholders. DevOps engineers help to bridge the gap between these traditionally 
isolated teams, promoting better communication and collaboration.

Faster Delivery: Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) are DevOps approaches 
that automate and streamline software development and deployment processes. 
This results in speedier software delivery, allowing businesses to adapt swiftly to 
market developments and consumer needs.


Efficiency and Automation: DevOps encourages the automation of repeated processes, 
which reduces manual errors while increasing overall efficiency. Automation in testing, 
deployment, and infrastructure management enables teams to produce software more consistently 
and quickly.
