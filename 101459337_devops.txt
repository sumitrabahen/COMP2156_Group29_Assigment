DevOps (a portmanteau of Development and Operations) is an umbrella term for a set of processes, 

methods, and systems that facilitate communication, collaboration, and integration between 

development (application/software engineering), technical operations, and quality assurance (QA) departments.

It is a culture, movement, or practice that emphasizes communication 

and collaboration between "software developers (Dev)" and "IT operations technicians (Ops)".

It enables building, testing, and releasing software faster, more frequently, 

and more reliably by automating the processes of software delivery and architecture change.

It emerged as the software industry increasingly recognized that development 

and operations must work closely together to deliver software products and services on time.
