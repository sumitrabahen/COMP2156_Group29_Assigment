Learning DevOps and becoming a DevOps engineer is increasingly important in the software development cycle for several reasons. DevOps practices bridge the gap between development and operations teams, aiming to improve collaboration, automate processes, and streamline the delivery of software.
Key reasons:
1. Collaboration and Communication
2. Faster Time to Market
3. Improved Quality and Reliability
4. Scalability and Flexibility
5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
6. Monitoring and Feedback
