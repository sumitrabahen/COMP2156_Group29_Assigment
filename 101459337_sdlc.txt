DevOps is a model for IT service management. IT Ops has evolved through several phases over the past few decades. 

From the early days of manual O&M to standardized O&M, automated O&M, to today's DevOps and AIOps.

In short, DevOps tries to break through the departmental walls of development and operation and maintenance, 

so as to open up the entire IT value delivery lifecycle, 

and realize efficiency improvement from product requirements to the whole process of online operation and maintenance.

The most significant role of DevOps is to improve the quality of enterprise product delivery, shorten the development cycle, and reduce failures. 

And cost reduction and efficiency is a big challenge for every company after digital transformation, DevOps undoubtedly hits the pain point directly.

As a DevOps engineer, in addition to having the basic programming skills of a software engineer, you also need specific interpersonal and tooling skills.

DevOps is a collaborative approach across software development, testing and deployment.

It brings together small teams of developers, testers, and ops with different goals to achieve more efficient and high-quality code releases, 
 
which requires that there be no communication barriers between the different roles in the DevOps process. 

Therefore, good communication skills (both verbal and written) are essential for good DevOps engineers.

DevOps encompasses development and operations, and is a general term for development and operations and maintenance. 

In the process of software design, the development department and operation and maintenance department should be 

coordinated to ensure the efficient use of various workflows and methods, and provide a reliable reference for project management. 

Software development based on devops originated from the traditional IT model in Europe in 2009, 

and plays a key role in solving operation and maintenance management problems. 

In order to consolidate the results of software design and development, the combination of development, operation 

and maintenance and testing together, formed the DevOps software development management model.

Based on DevOps software development can be applied to the test environment, 

and at the same time, the data package can be integrated into the software environment.
